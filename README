CGI-Authen-Simple version 1.0
==============================

CGI::Authen::Simple provides an easy OO interface to create form-based,
cookie-based, session-less (simple) authentication for web applications.
It relies on the presence of a database, and currently is only known to
work with MySQL. It may work with other databases depending on the hashing
functions they provide.

Some data is transmitted across the wire in plain-text each page submission
(via cookies), so for increased security it is recommended that your application
run on an SSL-secured web server.
